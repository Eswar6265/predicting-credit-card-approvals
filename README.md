Developed a predictive maintenance system using sensor data to predict failures and optimize machine uptime.

ðŸ“˜ **Project Description**
Predictive maintenance is crucial in manufacturing to reduce unplanned downtime and extend equipment life. This project explores real-world sensor data from industrial equipment to build a failure prediction system. By engineering features like power, heat index, and overstrain, the model anticipates failure types and helps optimize maintenance schedules. Multiple ML models were tested, tuned, and compared based on multi-class performance.

**Data Source:**

predictive_maintenance.csv: Includes temperature, torque, rotational speed, tool wear, and failure types.

âœ… **Project Tasks**
Load and explore machine sensor data

Clean and preprocess continuous variables

Engineer physical features: power, overstrain, heat dissipation

Correlation and pairwise analysis of inputs

Encode and classify 6 failure types

Train and tune Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models

Visualize confusion matrices and evaluate using F1/G-Mean

Compare models and select best based on macro performance
