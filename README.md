ðŸ’³ **Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction**

Built a credit card approval model to automate decisions using financial and demographic data.

ðŸ“˜ **Project Description**

This project tackles the real-world challenge of automating credit card approvals. The dataset comprises over 30,000 records, combining income, education, family status, and credit history. The goal was to predict whether a user would default, and therefore be declined or approved. Feature engineering, outlier handling, scaling, and model tuning were applied to maximize generalization.

**Data Files:**

application_record.csv: Demographic and financial profile

credit_record.csv: Historical credit behavior and payment info

âœ… **Project Tasks**

Merge and clean application + credit datasets

Engineer age, employment length, and income ratios

Normalize features and drop outliers

Label encode categorical variables

Visualize income vs family size and education vs default

Train/test split and handle class imbalance

Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest

Tune models using GridSearchCV (F1-score optimized)

Evaluate with classification reports and confusion matrices

### The Jupyter notebook contains the answer (code) for all of the above tasks:
